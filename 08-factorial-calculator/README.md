# 08 - Factorial Calculator

## 🚀 Project Overview

Calculate factorials using multiple methods: recursion, iteration, and Python's built-in function. Compare performance, display factorial tables, and learn mathematical properties!

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand and implement recursion
- Compare recursive vs iterative approaches
- Work with Python's unlimited integer size
- Measure execution time
- Learn mathematical properties of factorials

## 📚 What You'll Learn

### **Core Concepts:**
- **Recursion**: Functions calling themselves
- **Base Cases**: Stopping conditions for recursion
- **Iteration**: Loop-based solutions
- **Big Integers**: Python handles arbitrarily large numbers
- **Performance Analysis**: Timing code execution

## ⚙️ How to Run

```bash
cd Python_projects/08-factorial-calculator
python main.py
```
